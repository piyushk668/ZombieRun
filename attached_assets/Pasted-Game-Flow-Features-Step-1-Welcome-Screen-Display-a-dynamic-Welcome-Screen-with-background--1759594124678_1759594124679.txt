Step 3 – Tutorial and Start

Step 4 – Level System & Difficulty

Game is level-based, not endless.

Each level has increasing difficulty — faster zombie speed, more traps, and higher puzzle complexity.

Save user’s current level.

Step 5 – Core Gameplay

Main character continuously runs forward in a 3D jungle or city environment.

Collect green diamonds to increase score and unlock skins/power-ups.

A zombie constantly chases the player; if the zombie catches the player, the level ends.

Add hidden traps (e.g., collapsing floors, spikes).

If trapped, trigger a 60-second puzzle mini-game (like Candy Crush–style tile matching).

If puzzle solved → player escapes trap and continues.

If failed → level restarts.
